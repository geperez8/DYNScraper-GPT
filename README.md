### Briefly describe what the code is supposed to do.
The code was supposed to perform web scraping on the front end and prompt the user to a download the data as a CSV

### Does the code work? If not, what's broken.
The code doesn't work. GPT wants to create a backend for the application despite that not being optimal for the client. When I asked it to do strictly a front end it kept assuming I already had a backend set up or that the YMCA website was not feasible as a web scraping subject.

### How is the code better than what the team currently has?
I would say overall it isn't the only better thing than the user experience due to it having loading signs.

### How is the code worse?
Overall, it just couldn't write out the main part of the project due to having to view the YMCA HTML and assuming that the YMCA has CORS limitations

### How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
It took me about 7 tries even though it didn't end up being the best code. The rest wanted to create a backend or 

### Overall impression of the experience
I think the project is very niche/experimental so GPT can't do much to help
